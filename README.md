# 🏦 Fixed Deposit Smart Contract

## 📄 Project Description
The Fixed Deposit Smart Contract allows users to securely lock their Ethereum (ETH) for a fixed period, mimicking a traditional fixed deposit account. Users deposit ETH for a specified duration and are only allowed to withdraw after the lock-in period expires.

## 🌟 Project Vision
To provide a decentralized and trustless alternative to traditional fixed deposit systems through Ethereum smart contracts. The vision is to empower users with control over their assets while ensuring transparency, immutability, and automation.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🔒 **Fixed-Term Deposit:** Users lock ETH for a specific duration (in seconds).
- ⏳ **Time-Locked Withdrawals:** ETH is locked until the maturity period ends.
- 👤 **One Deposit per User:** Ensures clean management of funds.
- 📈 **Viewable Deposits:** Anyone can check deposit details for transparency.
- 📢 **Event Logs:** Deposits and withdrawals emit events for tracking.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- 💰 **Interest System:** Implement auto-interest or rewards for deposits.
- 🔄 **Multiple Deposits per User:** Enable handling of multiple fixed deposits.
- 🌐 **ERC20 Support:** Extend to support ERC20 tokens, not just ETH.
- 🧾 **Penalty Withdrawals:** Allow early withdrawals with a penalty fee.
- 🖥 **DApp Frontend:** Build a user-friendly frontend using Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- 🛡 **Security Audit:** Perform professional audits for safety and compliance.
